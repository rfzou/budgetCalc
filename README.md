# budgetCalc

This is a python project for applying python i/o, specicially file reading/writing to store data

The idea is fairly simple: write a program which will prompt me to input my spendings whenever the file is executed. Using input() and adding user input values to a list or dictionary didn't seem that hard


The first problem I faced was that editing my code every time the program ran was bad practise. To store the input data I would need to store it in a text file and read from it later on
